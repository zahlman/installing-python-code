# Installing Python Code

This guide is provided to help users understand the basics of setting up Python projects on their own computers. It's aimed at:

* People who are trying to get programs that aren't available with all-in-one installers, that happen to be written in Python
* People checking out interesting Python projects on GitHub
* New Python programmers who need to use third-party libraries (i.e., ones that don't come with Python)

There is no code here — please [proceed to the main Wiki page](../../wiki/Overview) to get started.
